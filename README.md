# Topic02 Representing Data

Assignment
Using the URL below
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=53.82&longitude=-9.5&current=temperature_2m
Write a python program called currentweather.py that will print out the current temperature on the console (and only the temperature)
I have set the lat/long to my location, you may use that or a different location.
Last few marks:
Look at the documentation (below) and print out the current wind direction (10m) as well.

# Assignment 3 from Topic 04 Reading apis in the wild

Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json".
Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment
Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"
This program should not be a long one
I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way
It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)
You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance, then finance indicators. yes it is difficult to find, that is part of the task, actually the easiest way to find it is search for it.

# Assignment 04 from Topic 05 Authentication

Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository, 
The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name. 
The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository (You will need authorisation to do this).
I do not need to see your keys (see lab2, to follow)
Handup: Push the program as assignment04-github.py to assignments repository.
Marks: Marks will be given for the functionality and layout of the code; I do expect minimal comments to indicate you know what the program is doing.
